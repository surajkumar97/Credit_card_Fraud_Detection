# Project Name:- Credit Card Fraud Detection
# Project Summary:
The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.
# Introduction:
In this project the dataset used containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Steps:
1. Merge both train and test.
2. Look into each of the columns.
3. Split data into train and test.
4. Model building and evaluation.
